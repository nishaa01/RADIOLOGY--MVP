# RADIOLOGY--MVP

# Radiology MVP

This project is a minimum viable product (MVP) for a Radiology IT system.

The goal is to simulate a basic radiology workflow:
- Patients getting registered
- Doctors ordering imaging studies (X-ray, CT, MRI, etc.)
- Radiologists viewing images (simulated) and writing reports
- Reports being stored and accessed

This repo is meant for learning and experimenting with healthcare workflows, not for production use.
